        “The Last Lecture: Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,” honestly really stuck with me. What hit me the most ws how he talked about obstacles. He said they aren’t there to stop us but to show how badly we want something. This made me think about challenges in my own life and how I can see them as chances to prove my dedication instead of giving up. I also liked his point about helping others reach their dreams. He believed in supporting people, and that really spoke to me because I know how good it feels to help friends or family succeed, and his message reminded me to keep doing that. I think it’s a reminder that success isn’t just about what you achieve for yourself but also about making a difference for others. Another thing that stayed with me was his focus on gratitude and staying positive. Even though he was seriously ill, he stayed positive, and chose to focus on the good things in life. That was super inspiring to me and made me think about how important it is to appreciate the little things and stay optimistic even when life gets hard. Overall, Randy's talk made me rethink how I see challenges and what’s important in life. He taught me to see the challenges as opportunities, to value helping others, and to live with gratitude. His ideas about never giving up, helping others, and being thankful are lessons I want to keep in mind as I work toward my goals.
